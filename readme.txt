= Support =

I whipped out this plugin in a couple of hours because somebody asked me if I knew of a plugin like this. It's not very well tested and is lacking in a few areas. I believe it's functional, but I'm not 100% sure. If you have questions, feel free to ask me, but please understand I might not choose to support this plugin. It was written on a whim. The code is GPL so please feel free to modify it yourself. If you'd like to take over the maintenance of the plugin, just let me know.
